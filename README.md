ABOUT

OrganicSmartHome (OSH) is a free and open source energy management framework designed to optimize energy usage in intelligent environments like a smarthome.

This framework was developed in response to the challenge of balancing supply and demand in the electric grid in spite of volatile, widely uncontrollable power production.

External signals, reflecting the state of the low voltage grid, are sent to
demand side managers or smart homes, which are able to adapt their energy
demand automatically without constraining the end consumer. Complying with
specific constraints specified by the appliance itself or by the user, the
load of appliances is shifted within the speci- fied degrees of freedom.
To manage these appliances and to efficiently integrate electric vehicles
as flexible energy storages into the smart home, decentralized measure and
control systems are necessary.

The energy management system is based on a hierarchical observer/
controller (o/c) architecture which has been developed within the German
priority research program on Organic Computing.

The aim is a mostly self-organized system which reduces the need for
interaction between the smart home residents and their appliances to a
minimum, while still allowing for explicit interference, if desired.
